_The music database for Banjo-Kazooie modding._

## Purpose
Welcome to Mumbo's Musicbox! This is a music database website that holds music files compatible with the game "Banjo-Kazooie". This is mainly a quick-access tool for modders to find music for their levels, but can also be used as a library to hear Banjo-Kazooie themed video game music.

## Navigation
> HOME
* The home page will update you with the most recent updates to the website, including new songs, site statistics, and maintenance updates.

> FIND MUSIC
* This is our public database of music, which includes mp3 playback, file downloads, previews, and sorting options. See more below under "Categories".

> COMPOSITION
* Interested in creating your own Banjo-Kazooie music? This section will guide you through making your very first song and directly implementing it into Banjo-Kazooie. It will guide you through basic music theory and mixing to help channel your inner Grant Kirkhope. You can follow the step-by-step guide on the website, or watch the YouTube video to help you.

> ABOUT
* This about section will tell you more about what Mumob's Musicbox is, as well as an FAQ for you to read through.

> SUBMIT
* If you have music arrangements of your own, you can submit them here by uploading ZIP, 7z, or RAR folders with your files inside them. Everything submitted on this page is sent to an Admin for review and later uploaded to the website. 

> DISCORD
* Here you will find invitation links to join various Discord if you so please. Banjo's Backpack & Banjo Speedrunning are two great communities with loads or resources and help, and Mumbo's Musicbox is our small community Discord.

## Supported Files
> MIDI
* Perhaps the most important file on this website, .midi files can be directly implemented into Banjo's Backpack for custom music. They are readily available to import into Banjo's Backpack, and have been tested before finalizing. Keep in mind that these files will sound off -- that is because of their respective .midi bank assignments, which will be corrected once they are imported into the game. More information can be found under the website's "Composition" tab.

> MP3
* Our .mp3 files give a brief preview of how a song should sound IN-GAME. Similar to MIDI files, these are simply approximations and may sound different in-game than their preview.

> MSCZ
* These are score files that are supported by MuseScore, a free open-source scorewriting software that is supported by most operating systems. This makes it easy for musicians to score out and make edits quickly. It also makes it easy to export to other file types, such as .xml, .midi, .mp3, .pdf, and so on. These files can easy be imported to other notation software like Sibelius or Finale.

## Categories

> GAME
