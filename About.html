                <p>
                Welcome to Mumbo's Musicbox! This is a <b>music database</b> website that holds files compatible with the game "Banjo-Kazooie". This is mainly a quick-access tool for modders to find music for their levels, but can also be used as a library to hear & enjoy Banjo-Kazooie themed music.
                <br><br>
                Our directory consists of music from other series, such as Mario, Pokemon, Zelda, Final Fantasy, and others. This variety offers a fun, nostalgic opportunity for modders and players alike. These iconic songs enrich the ROM hack experience through creativity and ambience.
                <br><br>
                Banjo-Kazooie is a game centralized around its music, which is clear from the hundreds of musical notes that are to be collected, and from the cheeriness of the Grant Kirkhope's music. Our goal is to preserve that charm and elevate the ideas of our incredibly talented modders through rich, captivating, and atmospheric music.

                <div class="content"><h1>FAQ</h1>
                <p><b>What is this "Banjo's Backpack"?<br></b>
                Banjo's Backpack is a modding software that allows for the modification of the levels, music, enemies, and objects found within Banjo-Kazooie. It allows the import of 3D models, MIDI files, and has the settings to tweak in-game behavior such as in-game text, enemy boundaries, camera triggers, etc. And in case you're wondering, no, Banjo's Backpack does not support Banjo-Tooie modding. More information can be found on their <a href="https://github.com/banjobackpack/Banjo-s-Backpack"> GitHub </a> directory.</p>

                <p><b>Can I use these songs for my ROM hack?<br></b>
                Of course! We highly encourage the use of any files being used for Banjo-Kazooie ROM hacks -- please just be sure to give credit to the artists (do NOT claim arrangements as your own).</p>

                <p><b>What file types are supported?<br></b>
                As of right now, our main files types we support are MP3, MIDI, and MCSZ files. These files are crucial to the development of BK modding, and helps everyone find the music regardless of musical knowledge. Above all, these file types are very flexible and allow for easy converting & translation.</p>

                <p><b>What is a MCSZ file?<br></b>
                MSCZ files are music notation files used in MuseScore, which is one of the most popular notation software available for musicians. If you are interested in composing music for yourself, I would likely recommend using MuseScore. It has a relatively easy interface compared to other notation programs, and does not require a musical background to get started with. Visit the <a href="Composition.html">Composition</a> tab for more information.</p>

                <p><b>Why do your MIDI files sound off?<br></b>
                MIDI files are the only compatible music files that can be imported into Banjo-Kazooie. However, instrument implementation isn't always 1 to 1. For example, on a MIDI editing software, Bank #3 will play as a Bright Piano, but in Banjo-Kazooie it will play as a Marimba. Visit the <a href="Composition.html">Composition</a> tab for more information.</p>

                <p><b>Why are some MIDI files greyed off?<br></b>
                Unfortunately, some songs will not translate very well into Banjo-Kazooie, and these greyed-off downloads are works in progress that need more time to adjust, test, and play correctly in Banjo-Kazooie. Thank you for understanding.

                <p><b>Where can I find level models for Banjo's Backpack?<br></b>
                As of right now, our website is <i>only</i> hosting music files. We will continue to implement more features along the way, so stay tuned! </p>
